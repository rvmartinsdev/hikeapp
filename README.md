# HikeApp

**HikeApp** is my first fully native iOS project, created as a sandbox for mastering SwiftUI design principles. The app’s core purpose is to showcase beautiful, high-fidelity screens with live elements and smooth, device-responsive transitions while practicing best-in-class asset and resource management (SF Symbols, color sets, localized strings, and on-device images). Every component—from navigation flow to interactive maps—was built with a UI- and UX-first mindset, making HikeApp both a design study and a foundation for future feature-rich releases.

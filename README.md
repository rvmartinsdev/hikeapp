# HikeApp

**HikeApp** is a hands-on iOS learning project that guides you through building a feature-rich hiking companion using SwiftUI, SwiftData, Combine, and Apple frameworks. You’ll gain practical experience implementing common app patterns and integrating platform services, turning this code-along into a portfolio-worthy app.

## Key Features

1. **SwiftUI Layouts & Containers**

   * Master `HStack`, `VStack`, `ZStack`, `LazyVStack`, and `GeometryReader`.
   * Build adaptive, scrollable trail lists and detail screens.

2. **Trail Browser**

   * Fetch and display a list of hiking trails with images and summaries.
   * Implement search and filter by difficulty, length, and region.

3. **Map & Location Integration**

   * Show trails on an `MKMapView` in SwiftUI via `Map`.
   * Track user location and display live position along a selected trail.

4. **Offline Caching with SwiftData**

   * Save favorite trails, recent searches, and downloaded map tiles for offline use.
   * Use SwiftData to persist user data locally.

5. **Elevation Chart & Graphs**

   * Visualize elevation profiles using `Charts` or a custom SwiftUI graph.
   * Pan and zoom to inspect key waypoints and elevation changes.

6. **Alternate App Icons**

   * Configure multiple app icons for light, dark, and seasonal themes.
   * Let users switch icons dynamically from settings.

7. **SF Symbols & Custom Icons**

   * Integrate SF Symbols for trail type, difficulty, and amenities.
   * Create and display custom symbol sets for branding.

8. **Notifications & Alerts**

   * Schedule local notifications for weather warnings or trail reminders.
   * Build an in-app alert system for arrival at key waypoints.

9. **Settings & Preferences**

   * Configure map styles (satellite, hybrid, standard), units (metric/imperial).
   * Toggle dark mode lock, select app icon, manage notifications.

10. **Accessibility & Localization**

    * Support Dynamic Type, VoiceOver labels, and color-blind–friendly palettes.
    * Prepare for future translations with `.strings` files (English MVP).
